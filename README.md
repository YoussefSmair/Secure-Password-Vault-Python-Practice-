This project is a simple command-line secure vault built using Python.
It allows users to store sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and notes inside an encrypted file protected by a master password.

The main goal of this project is learning and practicing cryptography concepts, secure password handling, and file-based data storage in Python — not building a production-ready system.

The vault uses modern encryption techniques such as AES-GCM for data encryption and PBKDF2 for key derivation, ensuring that stored data remains protected.

Users can initialize a vault, add new entries, list stored items, retrieve specific records, delete entries, and change the master password through simple terminal commands.
